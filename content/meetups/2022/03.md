---


This month [Hussein Al Abry](https://zidhuss.tech) will help us identify patterns that we should use/avoid in our code.

A technical presentation looking at code samples in Go (and other languages), and how they can be refactored to result in better code in terms of readability, performance and maintainability.

Pizza will be provided by our sponsors! 🍕
