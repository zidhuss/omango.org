---


This month we will have a short talk introducing Git and Github. The session will cover how to get started using git and Github to maintain code and collaborate with others.

Pizza will be provided by our sponsors! 🍕

#### Practical

Don’t worry if you can’t bring a laptop as there will be opportunities to pair program or simply observe others. If you do have a laptop, bring it along so you can take part in the practical session.
If you are bringing a laptop please charge it before arriving as we cannot guarantee plug sockets for all.
