> ~~This month Ahmed Magdi will give us on overview of how to validate business ideas by using lean experiments!~~
> ~~This talk isn't strictly related to the Go programming language so all are welcome to attend.~~

Due to unforeseen circumstances, our speaker is not able to attend this month's event.

Instead, we'll be bringing board games and having a social meetup. This will be a good opportunity to meet new people and network with the community.

Pizza will be provided by our sponsors! 🍕

If you're planning to attend, please sign up using [this link](https://tally.so/r/nG6LOZ). It's important that we order enough pizza for everyone.
