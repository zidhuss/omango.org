title: Programming Puzzle Night - 2023/01/25
---

This month we're running a mini programming puzzle.

If you have a laptop, make sure to bring it along so you can take part.
Make sure you have [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install).
There is a small prize for the winner!

Don’t worry if you can’t bring a laptop or are new to Go as there will be opportunities to pair program or simply observe others.

Snacks/Pizza will be provided by our sponsors! 🥐🍕

If you're planning to attend, please sign up using [this link](https://tally.so/r/wzEBA0). It's important that we order enough snacks for everyone.
