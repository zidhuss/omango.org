## About the group

OmanGo is an inclusive group of people of all abilities, from Go newbies to advanced users. We aim to be friendly, welcoming and have fun learning about, and sharing, our interest in the Go programming language.

We are based in Muscat, Oman and meet at Al Rud'ha on the first Wednesday of every Month:
