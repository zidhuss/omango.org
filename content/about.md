## About the group

OmanGo is an inclusive group of people of all abilities, from Go newbies to advanced users. We aim to be friendly, welcoming and have fun learning about, and sharing our interest in the Go programming language.

We are based in Muscat, Oman and meet at Rihal's offices on the first Wednesday of every Month:

We aim to have talks or workshops every month, but if there are no talks there will be a social meet.

OmanGo was started in November 2019 by [Hussein Al Abry](https://zidhuss.tech), [email him](mailto:hussein@zidhuss.tech) if you have any questions or suggestions.
